<h1 class="biohead">Eric Douglas' Bio</h1>

<p id="bio">
I am currently pursuing my bachelor of science in computer science
from Tufts University. My interests in computer science include
game development, artificial intelligence, and music applications.
I am also part of the varsity swim team at Tufts and swim the freestyle
and butterfly. In my free time I like listening to music, playing video
games, hanging out with friends, and reading.
