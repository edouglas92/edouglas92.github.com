<p id="bio">
I am currently pursuing my bachelor of science in computer science<br/>
from Tufts University. My interests in computer science include<br/>
game development, artificial intelligence, and music applications.<br/>
I am also part of the varsity swim team at Tufts and swim the freestyle<br/>
and butterfly. In my free time I like listening to music, playing video<br/>
games, hanging out with friends, and reading.<br/>
