Comp 20 Lab 3 README

To trigger the safari reader for my html page I wrapped the content in the body of my html file around an <article> tag. The song lyrics that appear on the web page live inside this <article> tag.

I correctly trigger the safari reader with my html file.
I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
The assignment took me approximately 30 minutes.
