Hey lady you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh Darling walk a while with me 
Youve got so much

Many have I loved
Many times been bitten
Many times Ive gazed along the open road

Many times Ive lied
Many times Ive listened
Many times Ive wondered how much there is to know

Many dreams come true and some have silver linings 
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

Mellow is the man who knows what hes been missing
Many many men can't see the open road

Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing bout a thing you really ought to know ooh
You really ought to know

Many times Ive wondered how much there is to know

Many many men can't see the open road
