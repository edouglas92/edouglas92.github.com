<p>
Hey lady you got the love I need</br> 
Maybe more than enough</br>
Oh Darling walk a while with me</br> 
Youve got so much</br>
</br>
Many have I loved </br>
Many times been bitten </br>
Many times Ive gazed along the open road</br>
</br>
Many times Ive lied </br>
Many times Ive listened </br>
Many times Ive wondered how much there is to know </br>
</p>

<p>
</br>
Many dreams come true and some have silver linings</br> 
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold</br>
</br>
Mellow is the man who knows what hes been missing </br>
Many many men can't see the open road</br>
</br>
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing </br>
Guessing bout a thing you really ought to know ooh</br>
You really ought to know</br>
</p>
